## LeapYear/PennyJar
  This program receives from the user their name, birth month and year and then determines what season they were born in and if it was a leapyear or not. This program offers a dual purpose: the user will be prompted to input the value of their piggybank and then it will count how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are inside of it!

#### Program was written in Python
